# Minimal Design Component (MDC) Manual  
### For: [Your App Name] - Personal/Project Manager  
### Purpose: Guide UI implementation with minimalist, modern design and consistent user experience principles.

---

##  Design Philosophy

- **Minimalist First**: Use whitespace strategically. Avoid unnecessary embellishments.
- **Modern Look**: Leverage modern UI libraries Tailwind, ShadCN, Radix and design language.
- **Focus on UX**: All actions should feel smooth, fast, and intuitive.
- **Async Ready**: Every component that involves async operations **must** handle loading, error, and empty states.

---

##  UI Component Expectations

### General Guidelines
- Use **modular components**: one component = one responsibility.
- All **async components must include**:
  - Loading placeholders/skeletons
  - Fallback content for errors
  - Empty states with helpful messaging

### Visual Language
- Neutral color palette (grays, whites, black) with 1–2 accent colors max.
- Rounded corners (`2xl` or more).
- Subtle shadows (`shadow-md`, no harsh contrasts).
- Smooth animations/transitions using `framer-motion` or CSS.

### Layout and Spacing
- Consistent padding/margin (`p-4`, `gap-4`, etc.).
- Responsive by default (mobile-first design).
- Use **grid/flex layouts** smartly to keep UI uncluttered.

---

##  Loading, Placeholder, and Empty States

### Always Include:
- **Skeleton loaders** for lists, forms, detail pages.
- **Spinners or progress bars** for interactions (form submit, API fetch).
- **Placeholders** when no data is available, e.g., "No projects yet. Create your first one!"
- **Error boundaries** to catch and gracefully display async failures.

```tsx
// Example: Async Component with Loading and Empty State
{isLoading ? (
  <SkeletonCard />
) : error ? (
  <ErrorMessage retry={refetch} />
) : data?.length === 0 ? (
  <EmptyState message="No tasks found" />
) : (
  <TaskList items={data} />
)}
```

## ⚙️ Development Best Practices

- **Component-driven** with Storybook or similar (optional but encouraged).
- Use **React functional components** only.
- Prefer **TailwindCSS** + **Framer Motion** for style and animation.
- Include **test IDs** for E2E/UI testing.
- **Avoid inline styles** unless absolutely necessary.

---

## 🛡️ Accessibility & Performance

- Use ARIA roles and labels as needed.
- All interactive elements must be keyboard navigable.
- Optimize for mobile & low-performance devices.
- Minimize re-renders; memoize when appropriate.

---

## 🔄 Versioning & Iteration

- All UI components should be version-controlled in a `ui/` folder.
- Components should be reusable and documented.
- Include changelogs for major UI updates.
- Conduct regular design reviews to ensure consistency.
